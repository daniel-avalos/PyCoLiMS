# menu_Testing
WiP side project, designed to navigate a given menu (i.e. cli toolkit to import and 
runs premade modules, authorizedfilesystem, send common cli commands, etc)

This project was inspired by Windows Server Core sconfig.exe and old school "Green 
Screen" programs used on retail thin clinents. These lightweight programs always 
facinated me, and I loved navigating to deep submenus with a series of quick keystrokes.
Hopefully this becomes a capable engine for future projects.



2018.11.10 - Initial upload. menuTesting2.py successfully chunks a given list into
    appropriately sizes sections. 
  ToDo: Reconcile with progress on separate machine, finish early stage nested list 
    structure to feed specific list bits and return entries.
